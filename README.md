# pico-tan


### Pico-tan will be able to:
1. do something with web scraping. ie give definitions/weather from google searches
2. do something with image processing. Most likely add scanlines to any image
3. do other stuff. like answer questions with 8ball addages or coinflips
4. be callable from the command line with commands like `pico 8ball`
5. discord integration?
